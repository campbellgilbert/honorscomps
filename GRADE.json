      "prompt": "In a 2016 interview published in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Maxine Hong Kingston, an award-winning writer famous for her novels depicting the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the United States, stated: 'I think that individual voices are not as strong as a community of voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truth.' Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which Kingston's claim about the importance of creating a community of voices is valid.",
      "text_sample": "The idea of a 'community of voices' sounds as though it would work on paper but is rather imperfect when you delve into the different implications it can hold for the community and just what it means to have one. While it could be that we should have something such as a community of voices wherein opinions can be expressed as a whole, one must take a closer look at what that really means. To have a community of voices, that would mean many people whose backgrounds can vary.",
