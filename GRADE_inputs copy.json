It wasn't until the twentieth century when the voices of many drowned out the voices of few within Washington. Posters didn't matter until held by millions. Black was bad until millions said it wasn't. And only then when more were involved than not, did Congress hear and respond. It took an entire Civil War to see the problem the first time and it took march after march, protest after protest to bring more change in the 1960s. But eventually, with the voice of millions behind the movement, the government listened and changed. The million voices said black isn't bad, something people now realize is true, and got the world to change because of it.",
